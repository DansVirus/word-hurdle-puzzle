## How to run this app.
<h3> Installing Flutter and Necessary Tools</h3>

### Step 1: Download Flutter SDK

1. Visit the official [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/).
2. Click **Get Started**, which will redirect you to a page with platform-specific options.
3. Choose the appropriate platform for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, or Chrome OS).

   For example:
	- If you're on **Windows**, select the Windows option.
	- For **macOS**, choose the macOS option.
	- For **Linux** or **Chrome OS**, pick the corresponding option.

### Step 2: Check Requirements (For Windows Users)

If you're on Windows, ensure your machine meets the following requirements:
- Windows 10 (64-bit).
- At least 1.64 GB of available disk space.
- **PowerShell** (pre-installed on Windows 10).
- **Git for Windows** (must be installed).

### Step 3: Install Git for Windows

1. Download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Ensure you select the version corresponding to your Windows architecture (64-bit).
3. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### Step 4: Download and Extract the Flutter SDK

1. Download the latest stable version of the Flutter SDK (v3.13.3) from the Flutter website. This will be a `.zip` file.
2. Create a new folder (e.g., `C:\src`) and extract the contents of the zip file into this folder.

   **Important**:
	- Avoid placing the SDK in a directory that contains special characters or requires elevated privileges (e.g., `C:\Program Files`).

### Step 5: Add Flutter to System Path

1. Navigate to `C:\src\flutter\bin` (or wherever you extracted the SDK).
2. Copy the path.
3. Open the **System Environment Variables**:
	- Search for **"Edit the system environment variables"** in the Windows search bar.
	- Click **Environment Variables**.
4. Under **System Variables**, find the `Path` variable:
	- If it doesn’t exist, create it.
	- If it exists, select it and click **Edit**.
5. Click **New** and paste the copied Flutter SDK path.
6. Press **OK** to save.

### Step 6: Add Dart SDK to System Path (Optional)

Flutter includes the Dart SDK, which is located at:
`C:\src\flutter\bin\cache\dart-sdk\bin`.

1. Copy this Dart SDK path.
2. Repeat the steps in **Step 5** to add this path to the system environment variables.
3. Move this path **above** the Flutter SDK path to prioritize it.

## Installing Android Studio

### Step 1: Download Android Studio

1. Visit the official [Android Studio website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Click the **Download Android Studio** button.
3. Select the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### Step 2: Install Android Studio

1. Once the download is complete, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Android Studio.

   **For Windows users**:
	- Double-click the `.exe` file to start the installation process.
	- Make sure to select the option to install both Android Studio and the **Android SDK**.
	- You may also be prompted to install an **Android Virtual Device (AVD)**. This will allow you to test your Flutter apps in an emulator.

2. During installation, Android Studio will install the **SDK**, **Emulator**, and **Android SDK Tools**. These components are essential for Flutter app development.

### Step 3: Configure Android Studio

1. After the installation, open Android Studio.
2. Complete the initial setup wizard:
	- It will automatically detect your available system settings and download the necessary components (SDK, platform tools, etc.).
	- Select the default settings unless you have specific preferences.

### Step 4: Install Android SDK Components

1. Once Android Studio is open, click on **More Actions** from the welcome screen and select **SDK Manager**.
2. In the **SDK Platforms** tab:
	- Check the latest stable version of **Android SDK** (usually the latest API level is recommended).
3. In the **SDK Tools** tab:
	- Ensure the following are installed:
		- **Android SDK Build-Tools**
		- **Android Emulator**
		- **Android SDK Platform-Tools**
		- **Android SDK Command-line Tools**

### Step 5: Configure Android Emulator (Optional)

If you wish to run Android apps on an emulator, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Tools > AVD Manager**.
2. Click **Create Virtual Device**.
3. Choose a device (e.g., Pixel 5) and select a system image (e.g., Android 13).
4. Download the system image if necessary, and click **Finish**.

### Step 6: Set Up Android Studio for Flutter Development

1. Open **Android Studio** and navigate to **File > Settings** (or **Preferences** on macOS).
2. Go to **Plugins** and search for the **Flutter** plugin.
3. Click **Install** to add the Flutter plugin.
4. Android Studio will prompt you to install the **Dart** plugin (required for Flutter). Click **Install** when prompted.

### Step 7: Set Up Android Studio Path in System Variables (Windows Users)

To use Android tools in the command line, you need to set the path to the `Android SDK`:

1. Find the path to your Android SDK:
	- In Android Studio, navigate to **File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK**.
	- Copy the path to the **Android SDK Location** (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`).

2. Add the SDK path to your system environment variables:
	- Open the Windows search bar and type **"Environment Variables"**.
	- Select **Edit the system environment variables**.
	- Click **Environment Variables**.
	- Under **System Variables**, find the `Path` variable, select it, and click **Edit**.
	- Click **New** and paste the path to the Android SDK.
	- Click **OK** to save your changes.
